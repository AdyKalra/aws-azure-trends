## Azure for AWS Professionals

|  AWS 	| AZURE	| Description |   	
|:-:  |:-:  |:-:  |
|||**Compute - Virtual servers**|
|Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Instances|	Virtual Machines	|Virtual servers allow users to deploy, manage, and maintain OS and server software. Instance types provide combinations of CPU/RAM. Users pay for what they use with the flexibility to change sizes.|
|Batch	|Batch|	Run large-scale parallel and high-performance computing applications efficiently in the cloud.|
|Auto Scaling	|Virtual Machine Scale Sets	|Allows you to automatically change the number of VM instances. You set defined metric and thresholds that determine if the platform adds or removes instances.|
|VMware Cloud on AWS	|Azure VMware Solution	|Seamlessly move VMware-based workloads from your datacenter to Azure and integrate your VMware environment with Azure. Keep managing your existing environments with the same VMware tools you already know while you modernize your applications with Azure native services. Azure VMware Solution is a Microsoft service, verified by VMware, that runs on Azure infrastructure.|
|Parallel Cluster|	CycleCloud	|Create, manage, operate, and optimize HPC and big compute clusters of any scale|

| NoSQL / Document	DynamoDB , SimpleDB , Amazon DocumentDB |	Cosmos DB	| A globally distributed, multi-model database that natively supports multiple data models: key-value, documents, graphs, and columnar.|
| Caching	ElastiCache	| Cache for Redis	| An in-memoryâ€“based, distributed caching service that provides a high-performance store typically used to offload nontransactional work from a database.|
| Database migration	Database Migration Service	|Database Migration Service	|Migration of database schema and data from one database format to a specific database technology in the cloud.|
|||**Containers and container orchestrators**|
|Elastic Container Service (ECS) Fargate |	Container Instances	|Azure Container Instances is the fastest and simplest way to run a container in Azure, without having to provision any virtual machines or adopt a higher-level orchestration service.|
|Elastic Container Registry	|Container Registry	|Allows customers to store Docker formatted images. Used to create all types of container deployments on Azure.|
|Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)|	Kubernetes Service (AKS)	|Deploy orchestrated containerized applications with Kubernetes. Simplify monitoring and cluster management through auto upgrades and a built-in operations console. See AKS solution journey.|
|App Mesh	|Service Fabric Mesh	|Fully managed service that enables developers to deploy microservices applications without managing virtual machines, storage, or networking.|
|||**Analytics and visualization**|
|Kinesis Analytics	| Stream Analytics , Azure Data Explorer, Data Lake Analytics| Data Lake Store	Storage and analysis platforms that create insights from large quantities of data, or data that originates from many sources.|
|QuickSight|Power BI |Business intelligence tools that build visualizations, perform ad hoc analysis, and develop business insights from data.|
|CloudSearch	|Cognitive Search	|Delivers full-text search and related search analytics and capabilities.|
|Athena	|Data Lake Analytics|	Provides a serverless interactive query service that uses standard SQL for analyzing databases.|
|||**Data warehouse**|
|Redshift	|Synapse Analytics	|Cloud-based Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) that uses Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) to quickly run complex queries across petabytes of data.|
|Lake Formation	|Data Share|	A simple and safe service for sharing big data|
|||**Big data processing**|
|EMR	|Azure Data Explorer	|Fully managed, low latency, distributed big data analytics platform to run complex queries across petabytes of data.|
|EMR|	Databricks|	Apache Spark-based analytics platform.|
|EMR|	HDInsight	|Managed Hadoop service. Deploy and manage Hadoop clusters in Azure.|
|EMR|	Data Lake |Storage	Massively scalable, secure data lake functionality built on Azure Blob Storage.|
|||**Data orchestration / ETL**|
|Data Pipeline, Glue|	Data Factory	|Processes and moves data between different compute and storage services, as well as on-premises data sources at specified intervals. Create, schedule, orchestrate, and manage data pipelines.|
|Glue	|Data Catalog	|A fully managed service that serves as a system of registration and system of discovery for enterprise data sources|
|Dynamo DB| Table Storage, Cosmos DB |	NoSQL key-value store for rapid development using massive semi-structured datasets.|
|||**Marketplace**|
|AWS Marketplace |	Azure Marketplace |	Easy-to-deploy and automatically configured third-party applications, including single virtual machine or multiple virtual machine solutions.|
|||**AI and machine learning**|
| SageMaker | Machine Learning | A cloud service to train, deploy, automate, and manage machine learning models.|
| Alexa Skills Kit |	Bot Framework	| Build and connect intelligent bots that interact with your users using text/SMS, Skype, Teams, Slack, Microsoft 365 mail, Twitter, and other popular services. |
| Lex |	Speech Services	| API capable of converting speech to text, understanding intent, and converting text back to speech for natural responsiveness. |
| Lex	| Language Understanding (LUIS) |	Allows your applications to understand user commands contextually. |
|Polly, Transcribe |	Speech Services |	Enables both Speech to Text, and Text into Speech capabilities. |
|Rekognition	|Cognitive Services	| Computer Vision: Extract information from images to categorize and process visual data. Face: Detect, identify, and analyze faces in photos. Emotions: Recognize emotions in images. |
|Skills Kit|	Virtual Assistant	|The Virtual Assistant Template brings together a number of best practices we've identified through the building of conversational experiences and automates integration of components that we've found to be highly beneficial to Bot Framework developers.|
